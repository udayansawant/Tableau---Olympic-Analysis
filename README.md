# Tableau - Olympic-Analysis

The visualisation has used preattentive attributes such as shape, size, orientation, colour, the position and Gestalt
principles such as proximity, similarity, continuity throughout the process. For the final analysis, all the three
graphs were connected together. In the first graph, the continuity principle was used to show the trend in the
participation of the athletes and the colour attribute was used to distinguish male and female athletes. In the
second graph, the proximity principle was used to align the medal together and the colour attribute to distinguish
medals. In the last graph, the similarity principle was used to show the similarity between medals and the colour
attribute to distinguish medals.

Some of the information noticed from the analysis are

  ● There was no Summer Olympics in 1916, 1940 & 1944 and Winter Olympics in 1940 & 1944, later on, the research found that it is because of World War.
  
  ● Only the first edition of the Olympics didn't have any female athletes. By considering the percentage increase in female participation from the last 30 years of summer Olympics, the female athletes will exceed the male athletes in 2020 Olympics.
  
  ● The USA has the most medal in Summer Olympics, but Russia holds that position in Winter Olympics.
  
  ● For the age group, 20-25 have the most number of medals.
  
  ● American Samoa has the highest average body mass index of 28.18 and Ethiopia have the least of 19.59.
  
  ● Athletics events have the most number of medals followed by swimming events considering both male and female athletes together. In the case of male athletes Athletics events have the most medal followed by Rowing events and in the case of female athletes swimming events have the most medal followed by athletics events.
